**VERCEL**: https://airbnb-clone-phi-jet-74.vercel.app/

## 🏠 Overview

This project is a full-featured Airbnb clone built *entirely* using AI assistance. It showcases modern web development techniques, responsive design, and React best practices - all implemented through AI-powered code generation.

The application replicates core Airbnb features including property listings, search functionality with filters, property details, and a responsive UI that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## ✨ Features

- **Property Listings**: Display properties with images, pricing, location, and ratings
- **Image Carousel**: Interactive property image galleries with error handling
- **Search Filters**: Filter properties by type, price range, and more
- **Property Details**: Dedicated pages for each property with comprehensive information

## 💻 AI Development Workflow
This project showcases the power of AI-assisted development:

1.I began by designing the initial UI using lovable.dev.

2.Then, I refined the design and incorporated additional components with the help of GitHub Copilot.
